 Neovim config files.

## Adding new plugins

To add a single plugin, create a file in `lua/plugins`
and write a single return statement that includes the Github `<user>/<repo>` identifier,
set the relevant `opts`, and set a callback function `config` that triggers after the plugin is loaded if necessary.

The return statement can contain multiple tables of different plugins to group relevant plugins
together in one file.
